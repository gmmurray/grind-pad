# GrindPad Future Feature Ideas

## Platform Features

_Cross-app functionality for the shared PocketBase backend_

### User Management

- **As a user**, I want to change my password so that I can maintain account security
- **As a user**, I want to reset my password if I forget it so that I can regain access to my account
- **As a user**, I want to delete my account data per-app so that I can clean up apps I no longer use
- **As a user**, I want to delete my entire platform account so that I can remove all my data across all apps
- **As a user**, I want to see what other apps are available on the platform so that I can discover new tools
- **As a user**, I want to navigate between apps seamlessly so that I don't have to log in multiple times

## Enhancement Candidates

_Features that extend the core GrindPad functionality_

### Global Search

- **As a gamer**, I want to search across all my games for notes and resources so that I can find information regardless of which game I originally saved it under
- **As a gamer**, I want to see which game each search result belongs to so that I can understand the context
- **As a gamer**, I want to filter global search results by content type (notes, resources, tasks) so that I can narrow down what I'm looking for

### Recent Activity

- **As a gamer**, I want to see what I worked on recently across all games so that I can quickly resume where I left off
- **As a gamer**, I want to see my recently modified notes and resources so that I can continue working on incomplete thoughts
- **As a gamer**, I want to see recently completed tasks so that I can track my progress across gaming sessions
- **As a gamer**, I want recent activity to show timestamps so that I know when I last worked on something

## Considered & Rejected

_Ideas that were discussed but determined to be out of scope_

### Import/Export

- **Reasoning**: Personal session management doesn't require data portability; most valuable context is mental rather than written

### Session Management

- **Reasoning**: Time tracking and session metrics add complexity without clear value for the core note/task management workflow; better handled by external tools if needed
